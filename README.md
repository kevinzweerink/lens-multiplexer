# Lens Multiplexer

A lens multiplexer is a type of visualization that can be used to identify lines of flight between philosophical lenses. It consists of two inter-connected types of data: *lenses* and *material*. Each *lens* represents a philosophical framework. A *lens* itself consists of two or more *poles*, or extrema essential to the structure of the *lens*. The *material* is an arbitrary set of data points that can be viewed through the *lenses* in the visualization.

The visualization itself is created by treating each lens as a ring of poles. The circumference of this ring is variable and arbitrary, the positioning of the poles along its edge must be equidistant. Each lens is an independent ring of poles that can be resized and rotated independently of the others, but within which each pole maintains a constant relationship to the other poles within that same lens. The material is then placed into this system of poles and lenses, each piece represented by a single, independent node. These nodes are given quantitative ratings representing their affinity for each pole within each lens, and in the context of the visualization these ratings are transformed into a degree of attraction to each pole that the material node has an affinity for.

The utility of the visualization is found as one rearranges the size and rotation of each lens. By rotating and scaling the lens-rings about the center, one can see how the rings' relation to each-other affects the arrangement of the material in the visualization. Different readings can be made of different organizational patterns.

## Hypotheses

Here are a few ideas about different interpretations of specific patterns of material.

### Clear Groupings

If, after the lenses have been arranged, the material separates itself into observable groupings, a meaningful relationship has been found between at least two lenses. If two poles of different lenses sit very near each-other, there may be a line of flight between these two lenses that passes through the adjacent poles.

### Even/Random Distribution

On the other hand, if a certain arrangement of the lenses causes the material to form an evenly distributed field, it is likely that the lenses being analyzed do not resonate in this arrangement.
